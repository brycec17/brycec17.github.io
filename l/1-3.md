# 1.3 - Adjectives

Adjectives serve as a way to describe nouns that immediately follow them. In Japanese, there are two types of adjectives: な-adjectives and い-adjectives.

### な-adjectives

な-verbs act essentially the same as nouns do. A な-adjective modifies a noun by appending な after the adjective.

Example 1:
1. 静かな人 - quiet person

In addition to using 「な」 to modify nouns, な-adjectives can also act as nouns themselves.

Example 2:
1. 静かは人だ。 - The person is quiet.
2. 友達は親切な人だ。 - The friend is a kind person.

However, it would be ungrammatical to have a construction such as 「親切は友達人だ。」, the noun *must* come first.

Example 3:
1. トムは魚が好きだ。- Tom likes fish.
2. トムは魚が好きではない。- Tom doesn't like fish.
3. トムは魚が好きだった。- Tom liked fish.
4. トムは魚が好きではなかった。- Tom didn't like fish.

Even entire noun clauses can be described by an adjective.

Example 4:
1. 魚が好きではないタイプは、肉が好きだ。- The type of people who don't like fish like meat.

### い-adjectives

い-adjectives are different than な-adjectives in that they do not act like nouns, and conjugate for tense and negativity. They always end in the hiragana character 「い」. Adding 「な」 to the end of adjectives to modify nouns is not necessary.

Example 1:
1. 嫌いな食べ物 - distasteful food
2. おいしい食べ物 - tasty food

When ending a sentence with an い-adjective, だ is always used regardless of conjugation for the い-adjective.

Example 2:
1. その食べ物はおいしいだ。- That food is tasty.
2. その食べ物はおいしくないだ。- That food is not tasty.

To form the negative form of an い-adjective, drop the final 「い」 and append 「くない」.

Example 3:
1. 私の猫は小さいだ。- My cat is small.
2. 私の猫は小さくない。- My cat is not small.

To form the past form of an い-adjective, drop the final 「い」and append 「かった」. For the past negative form, append 「くなかった」.

Example 4:
1. このビルは高かっただ。- This building was tall.
2. このビルは高くなかった。- This building wasn't tall.

As with な-adjectives, you can have entire noun clauses be modified by an い-adjective.

Example 5:
1. 値段が高いレストランはあまり好きではない。- I don't like expensive restaurants very much.
2. 値段が高くないレストランは好きだ。- I like cheap restaurants.

In the case of 1., 「ねだんが高い」is modifying 「レストラン」, which as a whole is being modified by the adjectival phrase 「あまり好き」. 

### An exception - 「いい」

There is one い-adjective that is an exception to the rule: 「いい」, which comes from the word 「よい」. As a result of it's etymology, it is always conjugated as 「よい」 when not in the plain positive form.

Example 1:
1. 値段がいいだ。- The price is good.
2. 値段がよくないだ。- The price is not good.

Another adjective that acts like this is 「かっこいい」, which is a derivative of 「いい」.

Example 2:
1. 彼がかっこいいだ。- He is cool.
2. 彼がかっこよくないだ。- He is not cool.
